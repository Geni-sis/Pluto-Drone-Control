# Inter-IIT

The following is our solution to the Drona Aviation PS as a part of Inter IIT Tech Meet 11.0-

The task 1 folder contains 2 files -
  
    1.For reading keyboard inputs
    2.For communicating with drone depending on these inputs 
  
The keyboard commands for the same are as follows- w- Pitch a- Counter Roll s- Counter Pitch d- Roll

The task 2 folder again contains 2 files-

    1. Task-2_Hover
    2. Setpoint_Controller 
 
The first uses a PID control algo for hovering the drone at a particular height (1 meter), you may change this value by changing the   "height_set" variable The second code very similar to "Hover_Controller" uses PID control to move the drone in a rectangular fashion
